How this started
=================

Catching inspiration by the tail is nearly impossible. Inspiration grabs us by the neck whenever it wants, randomly, and unexpectedly. Inspiration's elixir is, well, anything. Half-lifed is the culmination of a lot of thinking, sorting out what it means to be 50, your life half lived, finding yourself and being comfortable with where self is found. 

Done a lot of thinking, doing a lot of thinking. The thinking part never ends. Never. Eventually the doing has to happen. In other words, the inspiration.

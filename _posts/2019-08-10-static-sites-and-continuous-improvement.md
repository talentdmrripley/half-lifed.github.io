Being 50, the web has intrigued me for decades. The tools have evolved and made things easier to build and deploy sites faster than ever. I'm not a developer, though. That's a skillset that's always eluded my time and commitment to become efficient and confident at coding. 

I'm what you'd call a classic "dabbler," just dangerous enough to build, write content, and launch sites. Nothing to be proud of, but proud of trying, learning, and stretching my skills if possible. Learning the relationship between databases like MySQL and and PHP. This after building page after page after link after link to make a cohesive content experience for web "surfers." PHP was my introduction to a rudimentary CMS (content management system). The sites became more functional in less time while content became easily created and changed if necessary. Wordpress became and thing and—WOW—here's this team of 100s really pushing the envelope of what's possible for content on a screen. Why reinvent the wheel every time, I thought. 

Ruby on Rails was next. "Make a blog in less than five minutes." I was hooked, so I dabbed a bit more. Again, not proud of anything. Just proud of pushing myself into new methods and various ways to manage and deploy content.
